Pantry Raid

You are the owner of a restaurant, and your customers expect their meals to be delivered within 2 minutes.

You are given x number of meals from different dishes to cook within that time.

While you are cooking, giant roches will come out of a interdimentional portal and take your food. The rate at which they come out of the portal increases over time. If you throw your knife at them, they die.
